new functions for TidalCycles pattern manipulation

## contributing

please work on separate branches, we'll merge them together at the end

> tip: after you run `stack build`, you can use `stack ghci i.hs` to import some functions which make it easier to test your patterns outside of tidalcycles

## documentation

see [morecycles.pdf](morecycles.pdf)
