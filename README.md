new functions for TidalCycles pattern manipulation

## Installing

For an easy pure Haskell installation, you can run `stack build`. With `stack ghci i.hs` you can start the REPL to test your patterns outside of TidalCycles.
With `stack test` you can run some of the automatic tests we have for the jumble function.

If you want the full experience with sound, you will have to go through the TidalCycles installation process (not for the faint of heart):

Windows: https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/windows_install/
MacOS: https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install
Linux: https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/linux_install

This will allow you to hear our lovely patterns.

## contributing

please work on separate branches, we'll merge them together at the end

> tip: after you run `stack build`, you can use `stack ghci i.hs` to import some functions which make it easier to test your patterns outside of tidalcycles
